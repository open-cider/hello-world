# Hello World Demo App

This example introduces the Open Cider authentication process and how you would integrate it into a web application developed with Vue 3 and Vite. It can also be used as a quickstart to bootstrap your applications.

## How it works
Open Cider provides an easy and transparent way to authenticate users via a simple REST API. All data is sent securely over HTTPS to ensure privacy and security. The availability of granular permission control means users expressly consent to which of their data you can access and how. This coupled with an immutable blockchain-like activity log promotes ultimate transparency and trust between both parties.

## Getting Started
1. Create a developer account [here](https://dev.opencider.com).
2. We will need a user account as well to test. Feel free to create one [here](https://app.opencider.com).
3. Clone this repository.
4. Run ```cd hello-world``` to enter the app directory.
5. In your developer account, create a service with a unique name.
6. Generate a service api-key and apply the key [here](src/stores/auth.ts).

## Contributing
We welcome contributions from anyone interested in helping improve Open Cider. If you'd like to contribute, you can start by testing the platform rigorously. We are in beta and would appreciate feedback as we work out its kinks. Another way is to contribute to any of our repos. We advise raising any updates as issues first to prevent duplication of efforts.
